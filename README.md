### Hi, I'm Alberto Montalesi

Software developer with over 7 years of experience building enterprise SaaS. A self-taught full-stack developer from Italy, now based in Vietnam, working with Angular, PostgreSQL, and AWS to create robust enterprise solutions.

Being passionate about JavaScript and the web, I wrote and published the book [Complete Guide to Modern JavaScript](https://github.com/AlbertoMontalesi/The-complete-guide-to-modern-JavaScript), now at its fourth edition which I've also turned into a Course On [Educative](https://www.educative.io/courses/complete-guide-to-modern-javascript?aff=BqmB).

I also wrote some tutorials and other (hopefully) useful articles on my website [Montalesi.dev](montalesi.dev/).

### Personal Projects I've worked on

You can find my other projects here [https://montalesi.dev/projects](https://montalesi.dev/projects).

One that i particuarlly liked developing was a map comparison tool that allows you to draw a shape on one map and see how it compares on up to 3 other maps.It was built using Angular and LeafletJS; i've reworked it in 2023 to use NextJS and MapBox. I ws inspired by MapFrappe after it stopped working.
