### Hi, I'm Alberto Montalesi

I'm a self taught full stack developer from Italy, currently located in Vietnam where I work on enterprise software using a stack comprised of Angular,MySQL and AWS.

Being passionate about JavaScript and the web, I wrote and published the book [Complete Guide to Modern JavaScript](https://github.com/AlbertoMontalesi/The-complete-guide-to-modern-JavaScript), now at its third edition which I've also turned into a Course On [Educative](https://www.educative.io/courses/complete-guide-to-modern-javascript?aff=BqmB).

I also write tutorials and other (hopefully) useful articles on my website [InspiredWebDev](https://inspiredwebdev.com/).

I'm currently creating a series where I explain how to complete several challenges from CodeWars, you can find it at this [link](https://inspiredwebdev.com/challenges) while at the same time working on another personal project that hopefully will be released by the end of the year.

### Other Projects

In November 2020 I've launched **[map2maps.com](https://map2maps.com)** a map comparison tool that allows you to draw a shape on one map and see how it compares on up to 3 other maps.
